<!-- Plugin description -->
Pretty JSON Log plugin for IntelliJ Platform makes NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON a.k.a. JSON Lines) logs more readable
in the console. It has the following features:

- **JSON Parsing**: Automatically parses each log line as JSON and extracts essential log information such as timestamp,
  log level, and message.
- **Colorful Display**: Displays essential log information in different colors depending on the log level to make it
  easier to read.
- **Readable Timestamp**: Formats the timestamp in a human-friendly format.
- **Expandable Pretty JSON**: Prints a well-formatted JSON string following the log message. The JSON string is folded
  by default, but you can expand it when you need to view the full details.
- **Seamless Integration**: Supports various log formats such
  as [Logstash](https://github.com/logfellow/logstash-logback-encoder), [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan),
  [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino), [log/slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog),
  [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/structured-logging), etc. with no additional configuration or
  software.

This plugin is useful when you are developing a modern system that outputs logs in JSON format. You no longer need to
switch log formats between production and local development environments.

## Installation

- Using the IDE built-in plugin system:

  <kbd>Settings/Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Plugins</kbd> > <kbd>Marketplace</kbd> > <kbd>Search for "Pretty JSON
  Log"</kbd> > <kbd>Install</kbd>

  ![Installation dialog](media/screenshot-installation.png)

- Manually:

  Download the [latest release](https://github.com/orangain/pretty-json-log-plugin/releases/latest) and install it
  manually using
  <kbd>Settings/Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Plugins</kbd> > <kbd>⚙️</kbd> > <kbd>Install plugin from disk...</kbd>

After installation, newly written JSON lines logs in the console will be automatically formatted by the plugin.

## Limitations

JetBrains IDEs provide different kinds of consoles for different run configurations, but this plugin does not currently
support all consoles due
to [the lack of extension points in the IDE](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-60196/TerminalExecutionConsole-Extension-points-support).
If the console does not have the context menu item "Pretty JSON Log", the plugin is not supported in that console.

## How to configure log colors

You can configure log colors from the <kbd>Settings</kbd> > <kbd>Editor</kbd> > <kbd>Color Scheme</kbd> > <kbd>Console
Colors</kbd> > <kbd>Log console</kbd>.

## How to see the debug log of the plugin

1. <kbd>Help</kbd> > <kbd>Diagnostic Tools</kbd> > <kbd>Debug Log Settings...</kbd>.
2. Add line `#io.github.orangain.prettyjsonlog` to the text area of the dialog and click <kbd>OK</kbd>.
3. Reproduce the issue.
4. <kbd>Help</kbd> > <kbd>Show Log in Finder/Explorer</kbd> to open the log directory.
5. Open the `idea.log` file and find the log of the plugin by searching for `#io.github.orangain.prettyjsonlog`.

Enabling debug logging may slow down the IDE, so it is recommended to disable it after reproducing the issue.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin is inspired by the [pino-pretty](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty)
and [bunyan CLI](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan). The great idea behind these tools is that applications should
write logs in machine-readable format (JSON) and pretty-printing for human readability should be done by another tool. I
am grateful to the authors of these tools.

Thanks to the [IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template][template], I was able to quickly start developing the plugin.
